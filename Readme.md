## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given a list of items (identified by name), calculate the total price of the shopping basket. The same item can appear multiple times.

### âœ… Example Input

```ts
["Apple", "Apple", "Banana"]

  - Reduces runtime errors and improves developer productivity.

- âœ… **Unit Testing with Jest**
  - Ensures correctness of calculations and offer applications.

- âœ… **Simple CLI Entry Point**
  - `index.ts` file simulates a sample basket for demonstration.
